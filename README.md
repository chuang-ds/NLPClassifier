# NLPClassifier

In this notebook we explore Natural Language Processing using recurrent neural networks. The dataset we use is the Keras Reuters newswires dataset. This dataset contains 11,228 Reuters newswires, each classified as one of 46 topics. In this notebook we train and test various RNN/LSTM models to recognize newswire topics using sequences of words.
